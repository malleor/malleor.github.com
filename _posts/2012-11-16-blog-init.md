I work in a team of [R&D engineers](http://ogx.mchtr.pw.edu.pl/) focused on developing full-field optical 3D shape measurement methods. We provide solutions for archiving museum pieces with extraordinary resolution, analyse shape curvature of patient's back to detect spinal assymetry and tracking movement of the body while walking. The latter keeps me busy for two years now. During that time a couple of pretty interesting technical issues were solved and I consider them worth a written word. 

My work involve mainly programming some hardware, processing images and analysis of 3D data. I will gladly share issues I encounter, which will mostly include C++ and Python-related topics, and some of 2D/3D stuff. Hope someone will find it interesting.
